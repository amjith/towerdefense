# Tower Defense

We are building a tower defense game. The goal is to prevent the enemies from reaching the end. Defenders are stationary mechanisms that can cause damage to enemies. They can be placed on the map by the player. Multiple defenders can be placed on the map as the game progresses.

It should have different courses. The enemies are entering from one side and trying to get to the other side. The courses have many turns and twists.

There should be multiple defense mechanisms that you can purchase. You start with 50 points and if you kill the enemies you get more points that you can use to purchase upgrades.

The defense can be short range and long range. It should have upgrade levels. It can also have spread attack capability. Upgrades can have multiple shots fired in rapid succession.

Different enemies have different health levels. So a single shot might not kill the enemy but multiple shots are needed.

## levels

Each level has different path shapes. Each level also has different enemies and defenders.

## defenders

Turrets - mechanisms that shoot projectiles at enemies. Different levels will have different speed, strength, range etc

Spike traps - Things in the ground that when the enemies go over it will hit them from underneath.

Fire traps - When an enemy steps on it this will shoot a fire spread attack which will cause damage for neighboring enemies.

Sling shots - Long range weapons that shoots rocks.
